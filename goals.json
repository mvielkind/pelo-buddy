Most days I prefer a moderate intensity workout, but like to challenge myself with more difficult classes every now and then. I also like to have a recovery day with an easy workout and stretching. I do not like barre or pilates for strength workouts.

Strength classes should mix up upper, lower, and core classes.\n\nI like workouts that are a moderate to hard difficulty. Except yoga. I'm a beginner and prefer easier beginner classes. I do not like pilates and barre. Every few days there should be a recovery day with primarily stretching, low impact, mobility and/or yoga."}}
